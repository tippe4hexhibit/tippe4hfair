## Thank You for Considering Us!

Tippecanoe County 4-H Fair, in partnership with the Purdue University Extension Office, is pleased to announce the 2025 Tippecanoe County Fair, which will be held July 18 - 26, 2025. Since 1930, Tippecanoe County Fair has made every effort to create fun, family entertainment and provide the youth of Tippecanoe County the opportunity to showcase their skills and hard work. Additionally, we plan on continuing the tradition of offering great food, a fun mid-way, and lots of events to involve the community.

We are looking for sponsors to help make this annual county event a continued success and are critical as we look to continue to make enhancements to the fair each year. Sponsoring the fair is also a great way to promote your business or organization to thousands of potential customers, employees or donors within a single week.

We welcome donations of any amount to bring this event to the community. Please see our levels of sponsorship to see what works best for your business, organization, or yourself!
