Dear Friends of Tippecanoe County 4-H,

{{< /single-lines >}}

You are invited to join us for the Tippecanoe County 4-H Fair Livestock Auction on **Friday, July 28th** in the Tippecanoe County Fairgrounds Coliseum. The auction begins at **1:00 PM** and will continue until all eligible 4-H members have the opportunity to sell one of their animals. Our auction is a premium only auction, meaning: the 4-H member will get market value for their animal. You will be bidding to give dollars above that market value. Buyers will not be able to keep any animals after the sale. 4-H members often use their money to go toward their college fund and buy animals for the next year. By being an Auction buyer, you get the opportunity to support our 4-H youth and be recognized in front of their families and the community.

Becoming a buyer is easy. You can pre-register July 14 - July 25 at https://tippe4hfair.org/auction/. There is also an opportunity to register at the Coliseum on the day of the auction. When the auction begins, you will have a card for live bidding. We allow multiple buyers and once the gavel strikes "sold" the bid will be split equally between the buyers who raise their cards, unless arrangements have been made in advance. You can pay the day of the auction or we will invoice you. We are able to take credit card payments with an additional 3% fee. All registered buyers will receive a coupon for a free sandwich and drink at the Tippecanoe County Livestock Producers booth.

We are pleased to announce that we have partnered again with First Source Bank. Their team has volunteered to help run the auction and expedite the payments to our hard working 4-H members. We look forward to working with them.

The order for this year’s auction is: Rabbits, Poultry, Swine, Beef, Dairy, Sheep and Goats. Auction catalogs will be available the day of the auction, as well as published online as soon as possible at https://tippe4hfair.org/auction/buyers/. Additional details on the premium only auction are referenced on enclosed document. For questions, please contact Jason Buck at (765) 404-0793 or the Tippecanoe County Extension office at (765) 474-0793.
